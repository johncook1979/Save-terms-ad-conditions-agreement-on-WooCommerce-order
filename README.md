# Save terms and conditions agreement on WooCommerce orders
Although it's really not necessary to save the terms and consitions checkbox tot he WooCOmmerce order as it's impossible to complete checkout without checking the checkbox (if enabled), it can help by providing proof that a customer accepted the terms and conditions when needed.
This code snippet doesn't alter the checkout flow in any way, but will save the checkbox value to the order. It will then display the acceptance below the billing details as well as on the customer order email.
Add all PHP code snippets to the functions file of your child theme.
